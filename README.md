The profile will work for both the D2880 v1.2 and D1700. 
Follow the guild on setting up for specific printer at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWroeE1qIvZ9Lfj4p888_YUFqfQ1MhJDk4ygq8GzQNc/edit?usp=sharing

If you have any issues or make improvements please let us know at info@projectr3d.com

In August of 2018 we began splitting the FFF profiles into materials with similar printing properties 
  We did this due to Simplify3D making customization of individual filaments difficult without causing issues with other materials. 
  From here on please download the split profiles or just the ones you tend to use. 
    Thank you
